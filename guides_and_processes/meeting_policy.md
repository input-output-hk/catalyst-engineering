## Purpose

The purpose of this meeting policy is to ensure that software engineers at our tribe can effectively communicate and collaborate with each other and other teams, while minimizing disruptions to their work.

## Meeting Types
There are four types of meetings that software engineers may attend:

**a**. Stand-up meetings: These meetings are brief daily check-ins where each member of the team reports on their progress since the last meeting and what they plan to work on next.

**b**. Sprint planning meetings: These meetings occur at the beginning of each sprint (typically two weeks) and involve the entire team. The purpose is to plan out what work will be done during the sprint.

**c**. Retrospective meetings: These meetings occur at the end of each sprint and provide an opportunity for the team to reflect on what went well, what didn't go well, and what can be improved for the next sprint.

**d**. Ad-hoc meetings: These meetings may be called by anyone on the team or by other teams as needed.

## Attendance

Software engineers are expected to attend all stand-up meetings, sprint planning meetings, and retrospective meetings. If a team member cannot attend a meeting, they must inform the team as soon as possible.

Ad-hoc meetings may be optional depending on the nature of the meeting. If a software engineer is invited to an ad-hoc meeting and they are **unsure whether their attendance is necessary**, they **should speak** with their **team leader** to clarify.

## Meeting Schedule

Stand-up meetings will occur at the same time each day, with the exact time determined by the team.

Sprint planning meetings will occur at the beginning of each sprint, with the date and time determined by the team.

Retrospective meetings will occur at the end of each sprint, with the date and time determined by the team.

Ad-hoc meetings may be scheduled as needed.

## Meeting Preparation

Software engineers should come to each meeting prepared to provide updates on their progress, discuss any roadblocks they are facing, and contribute to the team's planning and problem-solving efforts.

For ad-hoc meetings, software engineers should familiarize themselves with the meeting agenda and any relevant materials beforehand.

## Meeting Etiquette

During meetings, software engineers should be respectful of others' time and contributions. They should actively listen to others, avoid interrupting or talking over others, and avoid distracting behaviors such as using their phones or laptops for non-meeting-related activities.


## Feedback

Software engineers are encouraged to provide feedback on the meeting process and suggest improvements. This feedback can be given to the team or brought up during retrospective meetings.
