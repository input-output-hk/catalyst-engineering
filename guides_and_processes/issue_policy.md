## Purpose

This policy outlines the guidelines for creating and managing issues within the Catalyst Engineering repositories.
The aim is to ensure all issues, tasks, features, and epics have clear and
comprehensive descriptions, acceptance criteria, and are effectively communicated among team members.

## Scope

This policy applies to all members of the Catalyst Engineering team involved in the development and maintenance.

## Issue Creation Guidelines

1. **Comprehensive Description**:
   - All issues must include a detailed description that clearly explains the problem.
   - The description should provide sufficient context, background information,
   and any relevant details to understand the issue fully.

2. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Each issue must have clear and measurable acceptance criteria.
   - Acceptance criteria should define what needs to be done to consider the issue resolved or the task completed.
   - Use bullet points or a checklist format for clarity.

3. **Additional Information**:
   - Include any relevant links, screenshots, or attachments that may help in understanding the issue.
   - Specify the priority and labels to categorize the issue appropriately.

4. **Assignee and Due Date**:
   - Assign the issue to the responsible team member(s).
   - Set a due date if there is a specific deadline for the issue.

## Issue Management

1. **Reviewing Issues**:
   - Assigned team members must review the issue description and acceptance criteria upon assignment.
   - If the issue description is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assignee must reach out to the issue creator for clarifications.

2. **Communication and Clarifications**:
   - Use GitHub comments to communicate any questions or requests for additional information regarding the issue.
   - The issue creator is responsible for providing timely clarifications and additional details as requested.

3. **Updating Issues**:
   - Update the issue description and acceptance criteria as needed based on the feedback and discussions.
   - Ensure all updates are documented in the issue comments for transparency.

4. **Closing Issues**:
   - Issues can be closed once the acceptance criteria are met and the work is reviewed and approved.
   - Provide a summary of the work done and any relevant notes before closing the issue.
