# Engineering Backlog Grooming

## Supporting definitions for Milestones, Epics, and Tasks

### Milestones

- **Key Progress Points:** Represent significant deliverable of value to the Catalyst platform or key events in the project timeline. In the context of the Catalyst road map a milestone can be associated with one release cycle. 
- **Phase Completion:** Used to mark the completion of major project phases or deliverables. A milestone is not considered complete until all associated Epics are in the completed status.

**Attributes:**
- **Name:** A clear and descriptive title for the milestone.
- **Description:** A brief overview of what the milestone entails and its significance.
- **Due Date:** The target date for achieving the milestone.
- **Associated Epics:** A list of epics that contribute to reaching the milestone.
- **Status:** Current state of the milestone (e.g., Planned, In Progress, Completed).
- **Owner:** The individual or team responsible for ensuring the milestone is achieved.
- **Dependencies:** Any milestones that must be completed or external dependencies before this milestone can be achieved.


### Epics

- **Large Bodies of Work:** Encompass multiple related tasks and provide a high-level overview of significant features or initiatives.
- **Structure:** Serve as containers for related user stories or tasks, helping to organize and prioritize work effectively.Each Epic must be associated with only one Milestone.
- **Completion** Completion of an epic indicates the completion of all associated user stories and tasks. An epic can not be considered complete unless all associated user stories and tasks are in the complete state.

**Attributes:**
- **Name:** A clear and descriptive title for the epic.
- **Description:** A detailed explanation of the epic‚Äôs objectives and scope and how it fulfills the requirements of the Milestone.
- **Associated Milestone:** The milestone that the epic contributes to.
- **Related Tasks/User Stories:** A list of tasks or user stories that fall under the epic.
- **Priority:** The importance level of the epic within the project (e.g., High, Medium, Low), Low priority epics can move to subsequent milestones.
- **Status:** Current state of the epic (e.g., Planned, In Progress, Completed).
- **Owner:** The individual or team responsible for managing and executing the epic.
- **Estimated Effort:** An estimate of the total effort required to complete the epic (not required up front and can be the sum of all sub tasks or user stories defined in the epic)
- **Dependencies:** Any epics, milestones or external dependencies that must be completed before this epic can be addressed.


### Tasks

- **Individual Action Items:** Specific, actionable units of work that contribute to the completion of an epic, the scope of a task should be such that it can be completed by a single engineer within the time bounds of a single sprint.
- **Purpose:** Tasks must have clearly defined goals, scope, and acceptance criteria to ensure completion by engineers.

**Attributes:**
- **Name:** A concise and descriptive title for the task.
- **Description:** A detailed explanation of what the task entails, its scope, external dependencies and systems, and supporting documentation.

- **Status:** Current state of the task (e.g., New, Backlog, Ready For Development, In Progress, In Review, Done, Blocked).
- **Estimated Effort:** An estimate of the time or story points required to complete the task. (Defined by the engineering team)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete, tasks that to not pass all acceptance criteria functional or non functional will be considered incomplete.
- **Dependencies:** Any tasks or external factors that must be addressed before this task can be started or completed.
- **Due Date:** The target date for completing the task.
- **Labels/Tags:** Categorization labels such as feature, bug, documentation, etc., to aid in organization and filtering.
- **Iteration/Sprint:** The sprint or iteration in which the task is planned to be completed.

- **Attachments/Links:** References to related documents, designs, or resources necessary for completing the task.




## Backlog grooming pre-requisites

Prior to backlog grooming **Milestones**, **Epics**, and **Tasks** must be defined, this is an iterative process and  **Milestones**, **Epics**, and **Tasks** may go through a number of iterations before being accepted. The following definitions and workflow is used to support the backlog grooming process to ensures that each level of work is appropriately scoped, reviewed, and meets the necessary criteria before advancing to the next stage and ultimately into the development backlog. In the absence of a dedicated scrum master, at each stage an owner(s) should be identified that will be responsible for ensuring the completeness at each stage. While the process provides structure, it remains flexible to accommodate change.

### 1. Milestone Definition

**Purpose:**  
Milestones represent the next major achievement or significant progress point in the project road map.

**Owner:**  
- **Product Owner (PO)**

**When/How Defined:**  
- Identified during strategic planning sessions and can be defined in advance of starting.
- Reflects key project phases or deliverables, the focus can be technology or business focused or can be across all concerns relating to the Catalyst platform and eco-system.

**Criteria Before Moving to Next Stage:**  
- **Clear Objective:** The milestone clearly defines a significant achievement.
- **Alignment with Product Goals:** Ensures the milestone supports overall product vision and objectives.
- **Feasibility:** Assessed by Product Owner, Architects, Designers and Engineering Managers to determine the feasibility of the milestone scope as a deliverable.

**Status:** 
- **Draft:** Initial draft of a milestone where the scope and goals have not yet been agreed.
- **Acceptance:** Ready for final acceptance by all stakeholders before it moves to the next phase.
- **In Progress:** Once accepted a milestone is in progress, a milestone has a delivery date but does not have a start date, work can start on a milestone well in advance of delivery if required.
- **Delivery:** Once all Epics associated with a milestone have been moved to the completed status the Milestone moves to the Delivery status. 
- **Complete:** Once all deliverables of a milestone have been completed and the milestone has been accepted by the stakeholders the milestone can move into the complete status.

**Note:** Git hub projects does not have status for Milestones (consider another approach here if required)

### 2. Epic Definition

**Purpose:**  
Epics break down milestones into high-level, manageable components that encapsulate significant features or initiatives.

**Defined By:**  
- **Architects**
- **Designers**
- **Product Owner (PO)**

**When/How Defined:**  
- After a milestone is established.
- During planning sessions involving architects, designers, and the PO (other expertise may be required at various times). 

**Criteria Before Moving to Next Stage:**  
- **High-Level Breakdown:** Epics should provide a broad overview of the work required to achieve the milestone.
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly outlines the boundaries and objectives of the epic.
- **Alignment with Milestone:** Ensures each epic contributes directly to the milestone‚Äôs achievement.
- **Initial Feasibility Assessment:** Evaluation to confirm that the epic is actionable and aligns with architectural standards.

## Backlog Grooming Process

Backlog Grooming is a crucial activity to ensures our **Milestones**, **Epics**, and **Tasks** are well-defined, prioritized, and ready for development. This process involves collective refinement and validation of Epics and tasks to maintain an actionable backlog with sufficient runway to accommodate the engineers velocity but not so long as to waste preparation effort if the product direction shifts.


### Roles and Responsibilities

- **Product Owner (PO):**
  - Defines the product milestones. 
  - Prepares and prioritizes backlog Epics and Tasks when required.
  - Ensures that milestones align with product goals.
  
- **Architects:**
  - Validate the technical feasibility of epics and tasks.
  - Breaks down milestones in to epics and tasks in collaboration with engineering, design and the product owner.
  - Ensure alignment with architectural standards and principles.
  
- **Designers & Design Manager:**
  - Provide input on design-related epics and tasks.
  - Ensure design consistency and adherence to user experience standards.
  
- **Engineering Manager:**
  - Facilitates the grooming sessions.
  - Ensures that the backlog reflects the team's capacity and priorities.
  
- **Developers (Backend, Frontend, SRE):**
  - Provide insights into task estimations and technical dependencies.
  - Ensure tasks are actionable and well-defined.
  
- **Testers/QA:**
  - Ensure that tasks have clear acceptance criteria.
  - Identify potential testing requirements early.
