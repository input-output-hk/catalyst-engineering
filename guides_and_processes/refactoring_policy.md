## Purpose

This policy outlines the procedures and guidelines for conducting refactoring sprints within the Catalyst Engineering project. The aim is to ensure code quality, maintainability, and performance improvements without affecting the overall project timeline.

## Scope

This policy applies to all members of the Catalyst Engineering team involved in the development and maintenance.

## Refactoring Sprint Schedule

1. **Timing**: Refactoring sprints will occur at the end of each milestone or at the beginning of a new milestone.
2. **Duration**: Each refactoring sprint will last for two weeks.
3. **Frequency**: Refactoring sprints will be scheduled regularly as part of the projectâ€™s development cycle, following each milestone.

## Refactoring Sprint Process

1. **Planning**:
   - Identify areas of the codebase that require refactoring based on code reviews, technical debt assessments, and team input.
   - Prioritize refactoring tasks considering the impact on code quality, performance, and future development.
   - Create a detailed plan and schedule for the refactoring sprint, including task assignments and expected outcomes.

2. **Execution**:
   - All team members must focus solely on refactoring tasks during the sprint.
   - Follow best practices for refactoring, including:
     - Ensuring functionality remains unchanged.
     - Writing or updating unit tests to cover refactored code.
     - Documenting changes thoroughly.
   - Utilize code review processes to ensure the quality and integrity of the refactored code.

3. **Completion**:
   - All refactoring tasks must be completed within the designated two-week sprint period.
   - Perform a final review and testing of the refactored code to ensure it meets quality standards and does not introduce new issues.
   - Merge refactored code into the main branch upon successful review and testing.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Engineering Manager / Technical Lead**:
  - Schedule and coordinate refactoring sprints.
  - Ensure that refactoring tasks are appropriately prioritized and planned.
  - Monitor progress and address any issues that arise during the sprint.
- **Development Team**:
  - Participate actively in planning and executing refactoring tasks.
  - Adhere to refactoring best practices and ensure code quality.
  - Communicate any challenges or obstacles to the Engineering Manager / Technical Lead promptly.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Team**:
  - Review and test refactored code to ensure it meets quality standards.
  - Provide feedback and request necessary changes before merging into the main branch.

## Tools and Techniques

- Utilize static code analysis tools to identify potential refactoring opportunities.
- Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage and track refactoring changes.
- Implement automated testing frameworks to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## Monitoring and Reporting

- Track the progress of refactoring tasks using GitHub project.
- Conduct regular check-ins and progress reviews during the sprint.
- Provide a summary report of the refactoring sprint, including achievements, challenges, and lessons learned.

## Continuous Improvement

- Review and update the refactoring policy regularly to incorporate feedback and improve the process.
- Encourage team members to share insights and best practices for effective refactoring.
