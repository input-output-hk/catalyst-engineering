#### Notes for engineers

During the daily standup each engineer should answer the following questions, try not to deviate from these to keep the conversation on topic and focused.

> ##### üìå Daily Standup Questions
>
> 1. **What did I do since the last standup to achieve the sprint goal?**
> 2. **What will I be working on today?**
> 3. **Do I currently have or foresee any blockers or impediments that will prevent me from completing my current task?**


> #### üí° **Note**
> In the absence of a scrum master the team should decide how they which to handle blockers and who should te assigned blockers as action items to assist the engineers become unblocked.

**What to Do:**  
- Define high level goal for the sprint.
- Review prioritized backlog items that meet the ‚ÄúReady‚Äù criteria.
- Confirm estimates, acceptance criteria, and dependencies.
- Ensure team capacity aligns with the planned work.

**What Not to Do:**  
- Do not introduce new, unrefined items on the spot.
- Do not create new tickets, tickets at this stage should have been viewed by many people and be in an acceptable state for engineers.
- Avoid deep architectural debates‚Äîif needed, schedule a separate tech discussion if required.

**Who Should Attend:**  
- **Mandatory:** Architects, Engineering Manager, Backend & Frontend Developers, Product Owner  
- **Recommended:** Designers, Design Manager (if design tasks are included), Testers/QA (if testing tasks are included)
  
**Inputs / Preparation:**  
- Reviewed and prioritized backlog items.
- Acceptance criteria and estimates in place. (can be completed by engineers separate from meetings)
- Any known dependencies identified.

**Expected Outputs:**  
- A sprint backlog with clearly defined tasks ready to be worked on in the next spring.
- A shared understanding of the sprint goals and commitments.

**Frequency:**  
- Start of each sprint (e.g., every 2 weeks).

### Backlog Grooming

**Purpose:**  
- Review candidate tickets/epics that have been prepared to ensure they have clear acceptance criteria, defined scope, and no outstanding dependencies.  
- Discuss estimates and confirm if the size of each task is manageable within a single sprint.  
- Validate that each item aligns with overall product and architectural goals.  
- Prioritize or re-prioritize items based on current project needs and constraints.  
- Identify any items needing further refinement before they can be moved into a ‚ÄúReady for Dev‚Äù state.

**What to Do:**  
- Review candidate tickets/epics, clarify acceptance criteria, confirm estimates.
- Ensure upcoming work is well-defined and aligns with product goals and architectural standards.
- Ensure each task/epic has the minimum required criteria as defined by the team (see separate document)

**What Not to Do:**  
- Do not involve the entire dev team‚Äîthis is a focused session for shaping work.
- Avoid unrelated technical deep-dives not pertinent to prioritizing and refining tickets.

**Who Should Attend:**  
- **Mandatory:** Architects, Engineering Manager, Product Owner  
- **Optional:** Others may be invited for specific expertise if needed.

**Inputs / Preparation:**  
- Product Owner prepares candidate backlog items.
- Architects/Eng. management review items for feasibility and clarity before the meeting.

**Expected Outputs:**  
- A prioritized and well-defined backlog of items suitable for the next sprint planning, this becomes the runway for engineering and does not need to be limited to just the next sprint, attempt to define a well groomed backlog for up to 3 sprints ahead, any further planning could result in wasted effort if the product direction changes. The length of the engineering runway will be determined by the engineering teams velocity over time.
- Clarity on scope, acceptance criteria, and readiness of items.

**Frequency:**  
- Weekly or Bi-weekly as needed before Sprint Planning, this does not need to align with the sprint cycle.

- Present well-defined technical issues, proposals, or architecture concepts.
- Seek input on technical approaches and finalize decisions where possible.
- Bring forward new ideas, concepts and approaches which can be discussed during the meeting or where preparation work is required at a future Tech Discussion meeting.

**What Not to Do:**  
- This meeting is an open technical discussion to cover all and any topics, it should not be used for planning or scope definition rather it should focus on technical approaches and proposals.

**Who Should Attend:**  
- **Optional (recommended):** Architects, Engineering Manager, Backend/Frontend Developers, Product Owner, Designers, Testers/QA, SRE, Operations.

**Inputs / Preparation:**  
- Prepare relevant documentation, code snippets, or diagrams.
