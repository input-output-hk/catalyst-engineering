# Releases and versioning

This document describes the current release and versioning strategy.
This strategy is likely to change as Catalyst's systems matures.

- [Releases and versioning](#releases-and-versioning)
  - [Backend](#backend)
    - [Release Cadence](#release-cadence)
    - [Library versioning and release cadence](#library-versioning-and-release-cadence)
    - [Data and communication versioning](#data-and-communication-versioning)
    - [Releases](#releases)
  - [Frontend](#frontend)

## Backend

### Release Cadence

New backend versions are released every two weeks (each sprint).
Sometimes we do out-of-schedule patch releases.

### Library versioning and release cadence

Each release include new versions of:

- All Rust crates
- All Python packages

We use semantic versioning. All versions are increased in lockstep, with a minor version bump each time (0.1.0, 0.2.0, 0.3.0, â€¦).

This means we might add breaking changes in each new release.

In rare cases we will do patch releases, e.g. 0.3.1, when there is a critical bug fix.

These patch releases will not contain any breaking changes.

We sometimes do pre-releases. Then we use the versioning 0.2.0-alpha.0 etc.

### Data and communication versioning

We have not yet committed to any backwards or forwards compatibility.

### Releases

Release builds and triggered by pushing a release tag to GitHub in the form v0.2.0.
If we are doing a patch release, we do a branch off of the latest release tag (e.g. v0.3.0) and cherry-pick any fixes we want into that branch.
